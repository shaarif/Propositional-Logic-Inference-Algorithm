Propositional-Logic-Inference-Algorithm
=======================================

Program to implement various inference algorithms for propositional logic (PL). The aim of logical inference is to decide whether KB ⊨ α for some sentence α. Following 3 specific inference algorithms are implemented 1) PL Forward chaining. 2) PL Backward chaining. 3) PL Resolution. The KB is given in the implication form of Horn clauses. Thus, it is necessary to convert KB into CNF form for task 3.
